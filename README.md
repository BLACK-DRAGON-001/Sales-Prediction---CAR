ðŸ“ˆ Sales Prediction Project
Overview
This project aims to forecast product sales using machine learning techniques, based on historical sales data.
The goal is to build a predictive model that helps businesses optimize marketing strategies and boost sales growth.

Problem Statement
Predict future sales using historical data.

Analyze the impact of factors like:

Advertising spend

Promotions

Customer segmentation

Handle missing values, detect outliers, and apply feature scaling to improve model performance.

Evaluate model effectiveness using appropriate metrics.

Dataset
Historical sales records with features such as:

Date

Product ID

Units Sold

Advertising Spend

Promotional Discounts

Customer Segment

Approach
Data Preprocessing

Handle missing values (e.g., imputation).

Detect and treat outliers.

Feature scaling using MinMaxScaler or StandardScaler.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Visualize relationships between features and sales.

Analyze trends, seasonality, and promotional effects.

Model Building

Split data into training and testing sets.

Apply machine learning algorithms like:

Linear Regression

Decision Trees

Random Forest

XGBoost

Hyperparameter tuning for optimization.

Model Evaluation

Metrics used:

Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)

R-squared (RÂ²) score

Compare different models and select the best one.

Final Model Deployment

Save the model for future predictions using joblib or pickle.
