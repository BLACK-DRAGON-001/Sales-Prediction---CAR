📋 Project Overview
This project focuses on building a machine learning model to predict product sales based on historical sales data.
It analyzes multiple factors like advertising spend, promotions, and customer segmentation to maximize revenue and optimize marketing strategies.

🎯 Goal: Deliver a reliable predictive model that businesses can use for sales forecasting and strategic decision-making.

🧩 Problem Statement
Predict future product sales.

Analyze and understand the impact of key features on sales.

Handle missing values, detect outliers, and apply feature scaling.

Compare different machine learning models for best performance.

🗃️ Dataset Information
The dataset includes:

Product ID

Date of Sale

Units Sold

Advertising Spend

Promotional Discount

Customer Segment

Other relevant attributes

(Dataset Source: [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yashpaloswal/ann-car-sales-price-prediction])

🛠️ Tools & Libraries

3. Model Development
Training: Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost

Validation: Cross-validation and Hyperparameter tuning

4. Model Evaluation
Metrics used:

Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)

R² Score

Visual comparison of model performances

📊 Results
Key Influencers Identified:

Promotional Discount

Advertising Spend

Customer Segment Type
